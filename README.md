# Professional-Portfolio
User story: 

This is my professional portfolio, featuring my current and future projects. 
This portfolio is designed to showcase a recent photo of myself, a list of my
qualifying skills, an about me section. as well my contact information.

You will see that in the navigation bar, there is a list of quick nav links to
take you whatever section of my portfolio website you would like. 

In the projects section I have images, with titles, that can be clicked on to 
take you to the corresponding application.  

I used html and css to build this website, using media querries.

Please let me know if there is any other information you would like form me.
